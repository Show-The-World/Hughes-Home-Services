            <p>We have used Hughes Home Services for more than 5 years. They have always been reliable and reasonably priced. They
                are prompt to reply and make every effort to meet our needs. We have recommended them to many of our friends and family
                who have always thanked us. They have been particularly helpful as we prepare our home for selling. We recommend them
                highly. As they have done many jobs for us, the costs have always been fair.</p>

            <p>Prompt and efficient work, from maintenance projects (painting, caulking) to add-ons (porch design/building to safety bars and railings and new toilet installation). Interior and exterior work, including work on trees and shrubs. I love the versatility and very fair costs. There is no down-time on the job. My go-to for all home assistance.</p>

            <p>Wendall came to help install safety bars after I had knee replacement surgery. He was so helpful, courteous, organized and clean that we brought him back for gardening projects, home repairs and now our kitchen renovation. He saved our pergola badly damaged after the derecho, took care of things my 91-year-old mom needed done with kindness and patience. He is awesome.</p>
